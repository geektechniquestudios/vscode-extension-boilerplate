# vscode-extension-boilerplate
The "yo code" command for building vscode extension boilerplate doesn't work out of the box currently due to some weird webpack config that's made, so this is a reference point for making a new vscode extension. I found it frustrating to fix every time, so I made this. The config used is webpack, npm, and typescript.

run `npm run watch` to make a dist folder.
